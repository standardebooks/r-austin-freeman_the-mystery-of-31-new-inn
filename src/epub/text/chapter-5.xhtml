				<h3>Jeffrey Blackmore’s Will</h3>
			</hgroup>
			<p>My arrival at Thorndyke’s chambers was not unexpected, having been heralded by a premonitory postcard. The “oak” was open and an application of the little brass knocker of the inner door immediately produced my colleague himself and a very hearty welcome.</p>
			<p>“At last,” said Thorndyke, “you have come forth from the house of bondage. I began to think that you had taken up your abode in Kennington for good.”</p>
			<p>“I was beginning, myself, to wonder when I should escape. But here I am; and I may say at once that I am ready to shake the dust of general practice off my feet forever⁠—that is, if you are still willing to have me as your assistant.”</p>
			<p>“Willing!” exclaimed Thorndyke, “Barkis himself was not more willing than I. You will be invaluable to me. Let us settle the terms of our comradeship forthwith, and tomorrow we will take measures to enter you as a student of the Inner Temple. Shall we have our talk in the open air and the spring sunshine?”</p>
			<p>I agreed readily to this proposal, for it was a bright, sunny day and warm for the time of year⁠—the beginning of April. We descended to the Walk and thence slowly made our way to the quiet court behind the church, where poor old Oliver Goldsmith lies, as he would surely have wished to lie, in the midst of all that had been dear to him in his chequered life. I need not record the matter of our conversation. To Thorndyke’s proposals I had no objections to offer but my own unworthiness and his excessive liberality. A few minutes saw our covenants fully agreed upon, and when Thorndyke had noted the points on a slip of paper, signed and dated it and handed it to me, the business was at an end.</p>
			<p>“There,” my colleague said with a smile as he put away his pocketbook, “if people would only settle their affairs in that way, a good part of the occupation of lawyers would be gone. Brevity is the soul of wit; and the fear of simplicity is the beginning of litigation.”</p>
			<p>“And now,” I said, “I propose that we go and feed. I will invite you to lunch to celebrate our contract.”</p>
			<p>“My learned junior is premature,” he replied. “I had already arranged a little festivity⁠—or rather had modified one that was already arranged. You remember <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Marchmont, the solicitor?”</p>
			<p>“Yes.”</p>
			<p>“He called this morning to ask me to lunch with him and a new client at the ‘Cheshire Cheese.’ I accepted and notified him that I should bring you.”</p>
			<p>“Why the ‘Cheshire Cheese’?” I asked.</p>
			<p>“Why not? Marchmont’s reasons for the selection were, first, that his client has never seen an old-fashioned London tavern, and second, that this is Wednesday and he, Marchmont, has a gluttonous affection for a really fine beefsteak pudding. You don’t object, I hope?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, not at all. In fact, now that you mention it, my own sensations incline me to sympathize with Marchmont. I breakfasted rather early.”</p>
			<p>“Then come,” said Thorndyke. “The assignation is for one o’clock, and, if we walk slowly, we shall just hit it off.”</p>
			<p>We sauntered up Inner Temple Lane, and, crossing Fleet Street, headed sedately for the tavern. As we entered the quaint old-world dining-room, Thorndyke looked round and a gentleman, who was seated with a companion at a table in one of the little boxes or compartments, rose and saluted us.</p>
			<p>“Let me introduce you to my friend <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Stephen Blackmore,” he said as we approached. Then, turning to his companion, he introduced us by our respective names.</p>
			<p>“I engaged this box,” he continued, “so that we might be private if we wished to have a little preliminary chat; not that beefsteak pudding is a great help to conversation. But when people have a certain business in view, their talk is sure to drift towards it, sooner or later.”</p>
			<p>Thorndyke and I sat down opposite the lawyer and his client, and we mutually inspected one another. Marchmont I already knew; an elderly, professional-looking man, a typical solicitor of the old school; fresh-faced, precise, rather irascible, and conveying a not unpleasant impression of taking a reasonable interest in his diet. The other man was quite young, not more than five-and-twenty, and was a fine athletic-looking fellow with a healthy, out-of-door complexion and an intelligent and highly prepossessing face. I took a liking to him at the first glance, and so, I saw, did Thorndyke.</p>
			<p>“You two gentlemen,” said Blackmore, addressing us, “seem to be quite old acquaintances. I have heard so much about you from my friend, Reuben Hornby.”</p>
			<p>“Ah!” exclaimed Marchmont, “that was a queer case⁠—‘The Case of the Red Thumb Mark,’ as the papers called it. It was an eye-opener to old-fashioned lawyers like myself. We’ve had scientific witnesses before⁠—and bullied ’em properly, by Jove! when they wouldn’t give the evidence that we wanted. But the scientific lawyer is something new. His appearance in court made us all sit up, I can assure you.”</p>
			<p>“I hope we shall make you sit up again,” said Thorndyke.</p>
			<p>“You won’t this time,” said Marchmont. “The issues in this case of my friend Blackmore’s are purely legal; or rather, there are no issues at all. There is nothing in dispute. I tried to prevent Blackmore from consulting you, but he wouldn’t listen to reason. Here! Waiter! How much longer are we to be waiters? We shall die of old age before we get our victuals!”</p>
			<p>The waiter smiled apologetically. “Yessir!” said he. “Coming now, sir.” And at this very moment there was borne into the room a Gargantuan pudding in a great bucket of a basin, which being placed on a three-legged stool was forthwith attacked ferociously by the white-clothed, white-capped carver. We watched the process⁠—as did everyone present⁠—with an interest not entirely gluttonous, for it added a pleasant touch to the picturesque old room, with its sanded floor, its homely, pew-like boxes, its high-backed settles and the friendly portrait of the “great lexicographer” that beamed down on us from the wall.</p>
			<p>“This is a very different affair from your great, glittering modern restaurant,” <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Marchmont remarked.</p>
			<p>“It is indeed,” said Blackmore, “and if this is the way in which our ancestors lived, it would seem that they had a better idea of comfort than we have.”</p>
			<p>There was a short pause, during which <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Marchmont glared hungrily at the pudding; then Thorndyke said:</p>
			<p>“So you refused to listen to reason, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Blackmore?”</p>
			<p>“Yes. You see, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Marchmont and his partner had gone into the matter and decided that there was nothing to be done. Then I happened to mention the affair to Reuben Hornby, and he urged me to ask your advice on the case.”</p>
			<p>“Like his impudence,” growled Marchmont, “to meddle with my client.”</p>
			<p>“On which,” continued Blackmore, “I spoke to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Marchmont and he agreed that it was worth while to take your opinion on the case, though he warned me to cherish no hopes, as the affair was not really within your specialty.”</p>
			<p>“So you understand,” said Marchmont, “that we expect nothing. This is quite a forlorn hope. We are taking your opinion as a mere formality, to be able to say that we have left nothing untried.”</p>
			<p>“That is an encouraging start,” Thorndyke remarked. “It leaves me unembarrassed by the possibility of failure. But meanwhile you are arousing in me a devouring curiosity as to the nature of the case. Is it highly confidential? Because if not, I would mention that Jervis has now joined me as my permanent colleague.”</p>
			<p>“It isn’t confidential at all,” said Marchmont. “The public are in full possession of the facts, and we should be only too happy to put them in still fuller possession, through the medium of the Probate Court, if we could find a reasonable pretext. But we can’t.”</p>
			<p>Here the waiter charged our table with the fussy rapidity of the overdue.</p>
			<p>“Sorry to keep you waiting, sir. Rather early, sir. Wouldn’t like it underdone, sir.”</p>
			<p>Marchmont inspected his plate critically and remarked:</p>
			<p>“I sometimes suspect these oysters of being mussels; and I’ll swear the larks are sparrows.”</p>
			<p>“Let us hope so,” said Thorndyke. “The lark is better employed ‘at Heaven’s gate singing’ than garnishing a beefsteak pudding. But you were telling us about your case.”</p>
			<p>“So I was. Well it’s just a matter of⁠—ale or claret? Oh, claret, I know. You despise the good old British John Barleycorn.”</p>
			<p>“He that drinks beer thinks beer,” retorted Thorndyke. “But you were saying that it is just a matter of⁠—?”</p>
			<p>“A matter of a perverse testator and an ill-drawn will. A peculiarly irritating case, too, because the defective will replaces a perfectly sound one, and the intentions of the testator were⁠—er⁠—were⁠—excellent ale, this. A little heady, perhaps, but sound. Better than your sour French wine, Thorndyke⁠—were⁠—er⁠—were quite obvious. What he evidently desired was⁠—mustard? Better have some mustard. No? Well, well! Even a Frenchman would take mustard. You can have no appreciation of flavour, Thorndyke, if you take your victuals in that crude, unseasoned state. And, talking of flavour, do you suppose that there is really any difference between that of a lark and that of a sparrow?”</p>
			<p>Thorndyke smiled grimly. “I should suppose,” said he, “that they were indistinguishable; but the question could easily be put to the test of experiment.”</p>
			<p>“That is true,” agreed Marchmont, “and it would really be worth trying, for, as you say, sparrows are more easily obtainable than larks. But, about this will. I was saying⁠—er⁠—now, what was I saying?”</p>
			<p>“I understood you to say,” replied Thorndyke, “that the intentions of the testator were in some way connected with mustard. Isn’t that so, Jervis?”</p>
			<p>“That was what I gathered,” said I.</p>
			<p>Marchmont gazed at us for a moment with a surprised expression and then, laughing good-humouredly, fortified himself with a draught of ale.</p>
			<p>“The moral of which is,” Thorndyke added, “that testamentary dispositions should not be mixed up with beefsteak pudding.”</p>
			<p>“I believe you’re right, Thorndyke,” said the unabashed solicitor. “Business is business and eating is eating. We had better talk over our case in my office or your chambers after lunch.”</p>
			<p>“Yes,” said Thorndyke, “come over to the Temple with me and I will give you a cup of coffee to clear your brain. Are there any documents?”</p>
			<p>“I have all the papers here in my bag,” replied Marchmont; and the conversation⁠—such conversation as is possible “when beards wag all” over the festive board⁠—drifted into other channels.</p>
			<p>As soon as the meal was finished and the reckoning paid, we trooped out of Wine Office Court, and, insinuating ourselves through the line of empty hansoms that, in those days, crawled in a continuous procession on either side of Fleet Street, betook ourselves by way of Mitre Court to King’s Bench Walk. There, when the coffee had been requisitioned and our chairs drawn up around the fire, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Marchmont unloaded from his bag a portentous bundle of papers, and we addressed ourselves to the business in hand.</p>
			<p>“Now,” said Marchmont, “let me repeat what I said before. Legally speaking, we have no case⁠—not the ghost of one. But my client wished to take your opinion, and I agreed on the bare chance that you might detect some point that we had overlooked. I don’t think you will, for we have gone into the case very thoroughly, but still, there is the infinitesimal chance and we may as well take it. Would you like to read the two wills, or shall I first explain the circumstances?”</p>
			<p>“I think,” replied Thorndyke, “a narrative of the events in the order of their occurrence would be most helpful. I should like to know as much as possible about the testator before I examine the documents.”</p>
			<p>“Very well,” said Marchmont. “Then I will begin with a recital of the circumstances, which, briefly stated, are these: My client, Stephen Blackmore, is the son of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Edward Blackmore, deceased. Edward Blackmore had two brothers who survived him, John, the elder, and Jeffrey, the younger. Jeffrey is the testator in this case.</p>
			<p>“Some two years ago, Jeffrey Blackmore executed a will by which he made his nephew Stephen his executor and sole legatee; and a few months later he added a codicil giving two hundred and fifty pounds to his brother John.”</p>
			<p>“What was the value of the estate?” Thorndyke asked.</p>
			<p>“About three thousand five hundred pounds, all invested in Consols. The testator had a pension from the Foreign Office, on which he lived, leaving his capital untouched. Soon after having made his will, he left the rooms in Jermyn Street, where he had lived for some years, stored his furniture and went to Florence. From thence he moved on to Rome and then to Venice and other places in Italy, and so continued to travel about until the end of last September, when it appears that he returned to England, for at the beginning of October he took a set of chambers in New Inn, which he furnished with some of the things from his old rooms. As far as we can make out, he never communicated with any of his friends, excepting his brother, and the fact of his being in residence at New Inn or of his being in England at all became known to them only when he died.”</p>
			<p>“Was this quite in accordance with his ordinary habits?” Thorndyke asked.</p>
			<p>“I should say not quite,” Blackmore answered. “My uncle was a studious, solitary man, but he was not formerly a recluse. He was not much of a correspondent but he kept up some sort of communication with his friends. He used, for instance, to write to me sometimes, and, when I came down from Cambridge for the vacations, he had me to stay with him at his rooms.”</p>
			<p>“Is there anything known that accounts for the change in his habits?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, there is,” replied Marchmont. “We shall come to that presently. To proceed with the narrative: On the fifteenth of last March he was found dead in his chambers, and a more recent will was then discovered, dated the twelfth of November of last year. Now no change had taken place in the circumstances of the testator to account for the new will, nor was there any appreciable alteration in the disposition of the property. As far as we can make out, the new will was drawn with the idea of stating the intentions of the testator with greater exactness and for the sake of doing away with the codicil. The entire property, with the exception of two hundred and fifty pounds, was, as before, bequeathed to Stephen, but the separate items were specified, and the testator’s brother, John Blackmore, was named as the executor and residuary legatee.”</p>
			<p>“I see,” said Thorndyke. “So that your client’s interest in the will would appear to be practically unaffected by the change.”</p>
			<p>“Yes. There it is,” exclaimed the lawyer, slapping the table to add emphasis to his words. “That is the pity of it! If people who have no knowledge of law would only refrain from tinkering at their wills, what a world of trouble would be saved!”</p>
			<p>“Oh, come!” said Thorndyke. “It is not for a lawyer to say that.”</p>
			<p>“No, I suppose not,” Marchmont agreed. “Only, you see, we like the muddle to be made by the other side. But, in this case, the muddle is on our side. The change, as you say, seems to leave our friend Stephen’s interests unaffected. That is, of course, what poor Jeffrey Blackmore thought. But he was mistaken. The effect of the change is absolutely disastrous.”</p>
			<p>“Indeed!”</p>
			<p>“Yes. As I have said, no alteration in the testator’s circumstances had taken place at the time the new will was executed. <em>But</em> only two days before his death, his sister, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Edmund Wilson, died; and on her will being proved it appeared that she had bequeathed to him her entire personalty, estimated at about thirty thousand pounds.”</p>
			<p>“Heigho!” exclaimed Thorndyke. “What an unfortunate affair!”</p>
			<p>“You are right,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Marchmont; “it was a disaster. By the original will this great sum would have accrued to our friend <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Stephen, whereas now, of course, it goes to the residuary legatee, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> John Blackmore. And what makes it even more exasperating is the fact that this is obviously not in accordance with the wishes and intentions of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jeffrey, who clearly desired his nephew to inherit his property.”</p>
			<p>“Yes,” said Thorndyke; “I think you are justified in assuming that. But do you know whether <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jeffrey was aware of his sister’s intentions?”</p>
			<p>“We think not. Her will was executed as recently as the third of September last, and it seems that there had been no communication between her and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jeffrey since that date. Besides, if you consider <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jeffrey’s actions, you will see that they suggest no knowledge or expectation of this very important bequest. A man does not make elaborate dispositions in regard to three thousand pounds and then leave a sum of thirty thousand to be disposed of casually as the residue of the estate.”</p>
			<p>“No,” Thorndyke agreed. “And, as you have said, the manifest intention of the testator was to leave the bulk of his property to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Stephen. So we may take it as virtually certain that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jeffrey had no knowledge of the fact that he was a beneficiary under his sister’s will.”</p>
			<p>“Yes,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Marchmont, “I think we may take that as nearly certain.”</p>
			<p>“With reference to the second will,” said Thorndyke, “I suppose there is no need to ask whether the document itself has been examined; I mean as to its being a genuine document and perfectly regular?”</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Marchmont shook his head sadly.</p>
			<p>“No,” he said, “I am sorry to say that there can be no possible doubt as to the authenticity and regularity of the document. The circumstances under which it was executed establish its genuineness beyond any question.”</p>
			<p>“What were those circumstances?” Thorndyke asked.</p>
			<p>“They were these: On the morning of the twelfth of November last, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jeffrey came to the porter’s lodge with a document in his hand. ‘This,’ he said, ‘is my will. I want you to witness my signature. Would you mind doing so, and can you find another respectable person to act as the second witness?’ Now it happened that a nephew of the porter’s, a painter by trade, was at work in the Inn. The porter went out and fetched him into the lodge and the two men agreed to witness the signature. ‘You had better read the will,’ said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jeffrey. ‘It is not actually necessary, but it is an additional safeguard and there is nothing of a private nature in the document.’ The two men accordingly read the document, and, when <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jeffrey had signed it in their presence, they affixed their signatures; and I may add that the painter left the recognizable impressions of three greasy fingers.”</p>
			<p>“And these witnesses have been examined?”</p>
			<p>“Yes. They have both sworn to the document and to their own signatures, and the painter recognized his fingermarks.”</p>
			<p>“That,” said Thorndyke, “seems to dispose pretty effectually of any question as to the genuineness of the will; and if, as I gather, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jeffrey came to the lodge alone, the question of undue influence is disposed of too.”</p>
			<p>“Yes,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Marchmont. “I think we must pass the will as absolutely flawless.”</p>
			<p>“It strikes me as rather odd,” said Thorndyke, “that Jeffrey should have known so little about his sister’s intentions. Can you explain it, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Blackmore?”</p>
			<p>“I don’t think that it is very remarkable,” Stephen replied. “I knew very little of my aunt’s affairs and I don’t think my uncle Jeffrey knew much more, for he was under the impression that she had only a life interest in her husband’s property. And he may have been right. It is not clear what money this was that she left to my uncle. She was a very taciturn woman and made few confidences to anyone.”</p>
			<p>“So that it is possible,” said Thorndyke, “that she, herself, may have acquired this money recently by some bequest?”</p>
			<p>“It is quite possible,” Stephen answered.</p>
			<p>“She died, I understand,” said Thorndyke, glancing at the notes that he had jotted down, “two days before <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jeffrey. What date would that be?”</p>
			<p>“Jeffrey died on the fourteenth of March,” said Marchmont.</p>
			<p>“So that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Wilson died on the twelfth of March?”</p>
			<p>“That is so,” Marchmont replied; and Thorndyke then asked:</p>
			<p>“Did she die suddenly?”</p>
			<p>“No,” replied Stephen; “she died of cancer. I understand that it was cancer of the stomach.”</p>
			<p>“Do you happen to know,” Thorndyke asked, “what sort of relations existed between Jeffrey and his brother John?”</p>
			<p>“At one time,” said Stephen, “I know they were not very cordial; but the breach may have been made up later, though I don’t know that it actually was.”</p>
			<p>“I ask the question,” said Thorndyke, “because, as I dare say you have noticed, there is, in the first will, some hint of improved relations. As it was originally drawn that will makes <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Stephen the sole legatee. Then, a little later, a codicil is added in favour of John, showing that Jeffrey had felt the necessity of making some recognition of his brother. This seems to point to some change in the relations, and the question arises: if such a change did actually occur, was it the beginning of a new and further improving state of feeling between the two brothers? Have you any facts bearing on that question?”</p>
			<p>Marchmont pursed up his lips with the air of a man considering an unwelcome suggestion, and, after a few moments of reflection, answered:</p>
			<p>“I think we must say ‘yes’ to that. There is the undeniable fact that, of all Jeffrey’s friends, John Blackmore was the only one who knew that he was living in New Inn.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, John knew that, did he?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, he certainly did; for it came out in the evidence that he had called on Jeffrey at his chambers more than once. There is no denying that. But, mark you!” <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Marchmont added emphatically, “that does not cover the inconsistency of the will. There is nothing in the second will to suggest that Jeffrey intended materially to increase the bequest to his brother.”</p>
			<p>“I quite agree with you, Marchmont. I think that is a perfectly sound position. You have, I suppose, fully considered the question as to whether it would be possible to set aside the second will on the ground that it fails to carry out the evident wishes and intentions of the testator?”</p>
			<p>“Yes. My partner, Winwood, and I went into that question very carefully, and we also took counsel’s opinion⁠—Sir Horace Barnaby⁠—and he was of the same opinion as ourselves; that the court would certainly uphold the will.”</p>
			<p>“I think that would be my own view,” said Thorndyke, “especially after what you have told me. Do I understand that John Blackmore was the only person who knew that Jeffrey was in residence at New Inn?”</p>
			<p>“The only one of his private friends. His bankers knew and so did the officials from whom he drew his pension.”</p>
			<p>“Of course he would have to notify his bankers of his change of address.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, of course. And apropos of the bank, I may mention that the manager tells me that, of late, they had noticed a slight change in the character of Jeffrey’s signature⁠—I think you will see the reason of the change when you hear the rest of his story. It was very trifling; not more than commonly occurs when a man begins to grow old, especially if there is some failure of eyesight.”</p>
			<p>“Was <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jeffrey’s eyesight failing?” asked Thorndyke.</p>
			<p>“Yes, it was, undoubtedly,” said Stephen. “He was practically blind in one eye and, in the very last letter that I ever had from him, he mentioned that there were signs of commencing cataract in the other.”</p>
			<p>“You spoke of his pension. He continued to draw that regularly?”</p>
			<p>“Yes; he drew his allowance every month, or rather, his bankers drew it for him. They had been accustomed to do so when he was abroad, and the authorities seem to have allowed the practice to continue.”</p>
			<p>Thorndyke reflected a while, running his eye over the notes on the slips of paper in his hand, and Marchmont surveyed him with a malicious smile. Presently the latter remarked:</p>
			<p>“Methinks the learned counsel is floored.”</p>
			<p>Thorndyke laughed. “It seems to me,” he retorted, “that your proceedings are rather like those of the amiable individual who offered the bear a flint pebble, that he might crack it and extract the kernel. Your confounded will seems to offer no soft spot on which one could commence an attack. But we won’t give up. We seem to have sucked the will dry. Let us now have a few facts respecting the parties concerned in it; and, as Jeffrey is the central figure, let us begin with him and the tragedy at New Inn that formed the starting-point of all this trouble.”</p>
